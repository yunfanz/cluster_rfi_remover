/**
* This kernel calculates the K nearest neighbours for the input matrix by chunking it into individual sections.
* This allows the GPU to do a KNN on datasets that are larger then the amount of memory on the device. It is to
* be called by splitting the input data into "Chunks" that fit on the gpu memory, and alternate them until every
* chunk has been loaded as both source and dest. This results in a complete KNN map for all of the data.
*
*
*
* @param source Our "Source" chunk of data to do KNN on
* @param target Our "Target" chunk, the chunk we are comparing distances to
* @param dimensions The dimensionality of the source/target data
* @param indices The indexes to the nearest k neighbours (matches with distances)
* @param distances The distances to our nearest k neighbours (matches with indices)
* @param kMax The number of nodes to include in our K nearest
* @param epsilon Our epsilon to limit the distance of KMeans by
* @param dataSize The total number of data elements we are processing (for bounds checking)
* @param chunkSize The size of our chunks (for bounds checking)
* @param sourceOffset The offset from 0 that the real (non chunked) index of our source chunk is
* @param targetOffset The offset from 0 that the real (non chunked) index of our target chunk is
* @param maxThreads The number of threads the host CUDA version supports
